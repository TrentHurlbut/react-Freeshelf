# React Freeshelf

After cloning the repo, run `npm start` to get your app up and going.

Freeshelf has available a short list of free programming books and educational materials. Expanded information includes a link to the book, when it was published, and an expanded escription.

`BookData.js` is an array of objects that the Freeshelf library draws from when rendering each BookCard component. Please feel free to add your own resources to this array!
